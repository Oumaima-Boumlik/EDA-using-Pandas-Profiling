# EDA using Pandas Profiling library
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the rudimentary stage of any data science project, It covers important insights, including the data type, range, distribution, the measure of cardinality (number or percentage of distinct values for each predictor variable), the duplicated and missing values, some descriptive statistics (count, mean, median, quantiles), and correlation of variables with each other, among other functionalities.

In this repository, I showed a simple example of EDA using the powerful library "Pandas Profiling", which automates the tedious process of Exploratory Data Analysis in one line of code!
